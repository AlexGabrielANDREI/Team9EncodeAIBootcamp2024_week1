Fantastic choice! Jollof Rice is a party favorite in Nigeria and is famous for its vibrant tomato base and aromatic spices. Here's how to make this delicious dish:

### Jollof Rice with Chicken

#### Ingredients:
**For the Chicken:**
- 1 kg chicken, cut into pieces
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 2-3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Jollof Rice:**
- 3 cups long-grain parboiled rice
- 6 medium-sized ripe tomatoes (fresh or canned)
- 1-2 red bell peppers
- 1 medium onion
- 2-3 cloves garlic
- 1-2 Scotch bonnet peppers (adjust for spice preference)
- 4 cups chicken stock or water
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 2-3 teaspoons thyme
- 2-3 teaspoons curry powder
- 1-2 bay leaves
- Salt to taste

#### Preparation Steps:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with paprika, thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Coat the chicken evenly and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight for best results).

2. **Fry the Chicken:**
   - In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and fry until golden brown on all sides. Remove the chicken and 
set it aside.

3. **Prepare the Jollof Base:**
   - In a blender, combine the tomatoes, red bell peppers, onion, garlic, and Scotch bonnet peppers. Blend until smooth.
   - In the same pot where you fried the chicken, add more oil if needed. Pour in the blended mixture and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This helps to fry the tomato base, which enhances its flavor.

4. **Season the Sauce:**
   - Once the sauce has thickened and the oil starts to separate from the tomato, add thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, and salt. Stir well to combine.

5. **Cook the Rice:**
   - Rinse the parboiled rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.
   - Add the rinsed rice to the pot, and mix it well with the sauce. 
   - Pour in the chicken stock (or water) until it just covers the rice. Stir, then add the fried chicken pieces on top. 

6. **Simmer the Dish:**
   - Cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to low. Let the rice cook for about 30-40 minutes, checking occasionally and ensuring the heat is low enough 
to avoid burning.
   - You can also place a clean kitchen towel between the pot and the lid to trap the steam, helping to fluff the rice.

7. **Final Touch:**
   - Once the rice is cooked and has absorbed the sauce, fluff it with a fork. Remove the bay leaves.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve your Jollof Rice with the chicken on top, paired with fried plantains, coleslaw, or a fresh salad.

And there you have it – a delicious pot of Jollof Rice with Chicken! Enjoy the vibrant flavors and celebrate the essence of Nigerian cuisine. If you have any questions or need tips, don’t hesitate to ask!
